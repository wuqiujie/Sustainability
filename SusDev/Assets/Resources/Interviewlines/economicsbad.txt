As a small business owner, I am struggling on the verge of bankruptcy. Residents in Shapetopia aren’t willing to purchase like they used to. 
After I graduated from college, I’ve been sitting at home looking for jobs for like five months. Can you believe that there are over 400 people competing for the same entry-level position at the same time?
I haven't gotten a raise in 10 years and with inflation. I can hardly afford the family expenses this year. Maybe next year I need to sell my house to pay for my kids’ tuition.
My son is moving out from Shapetopia to seek job opportunities like many other young people.
My artist friend had to work as a cashier last year, because she couldn’t sell enough pieces to make a living
