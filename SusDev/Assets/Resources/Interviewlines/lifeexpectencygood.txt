I feel like it’s easier to find a doctor this year.
It seems so much easier to find accessible health care at the hospital this year. When I felt sick, I just bought some over the counter prescriptions from the pharmacy because I knew I couldn’t rely on public hospitals with their unmanageable patient load. However, this year I felt like public hospitals became more accessible.
It’s really nice to see the treatments offered by public hospitals are improving significantly.  
I feel like my family and I are healthier this year. Thanks to significant improvements in the environment,we are all able to get more active and enjoy outdoor activities now.
I felt depressed from the work, but I could easily find a psychiatrist and it’s rather affordable. So I got well soon.
