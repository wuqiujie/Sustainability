It’s really nice to see the lake getting clear again. I hope I can go fishing with my grandpa in the near future.
I feel like the air quality has improved significantly in the past year. Recently, I started jogging again. You know, it was impossible to jog in the past years.
I found a squirrel in my backyard this morning! Holy moly! I haven’t seen a single squirrel for years! God knows how much I missed these lovely little creatures!
I am overjoyed to see our city’s waterways become clear and beautiful again. You know, in the past years it stunk and was covered with garbage.
The power plant near my home isn’t emitting that much ugly smoke and smell. I think it’s good for my kids’ health.
