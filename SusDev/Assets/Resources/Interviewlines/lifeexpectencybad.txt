I hope our government can address the issues in public healthcare. Everyone in Shapetopia knows our public hospitals are a joke.
My dad has been ill for 2 weeks. But he’s still on the waiting list of our public hospital.
I genuinely wish our public medical insurance could actually help us rather than provide us with a bunch of useless tablets.
I really wish there could be some public areas like a park or a basketball court in our neighborhood. 
I feel pretty down recently due to the heavy workload from school. I think I’m depressed… Can’t talk, need to go…
