I wish our government could pay more attention to the safety issues in our neighborhood. There are so many unemployed people wandering the streets. 
I hope our city could be more empathetic towards disadvantaged people by offering them more opportunities. 
I hope our government can improve our public transportation system.It is so difficult to get around without being able to afford a car.
Gosh, I really hope our government will bridge the gap between private and public education. The Current system makes me feel like decent jobs are exclusive to private college kids.
My sister lost her job last year. It's been hard for her to find another job. I wish we had more security payments.
