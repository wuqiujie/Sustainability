I hope our government can control the pollution of our city’s lake. My father told me when he was a kid, he always went fishing with my grandpa on weekends.
Well, I believe air pollution is a huge challenge now. This winter when it snowed, the snow was dark gray instead of white, covered by carbon pollutants.
I really wish our city’s environment could be better. Ten years ago, every morning I was woken up by birds singing. God, I missed those birds.
The sky has been gray most of the days. I really wish I could stare up and enjoy the beautiful blue sky in my backyard with a bottle of iced beer in my hand after getting home from work.
I hope there can be natural reserves which gives me a chance to see more wild animals and plants.
