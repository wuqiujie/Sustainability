I feel like our neighborhood became safer this year. I havenâ€™t heard of any burglaries happening in our neighborhood. You know they used to happen once or twice a month.
Well, I found there were fewer unemployed folks wandering the streets this year.
I feel our city is becoming more empathetic towards disadvantaged people by offering them more opportunities. 
I feel our city pays increasingly more attention to equity by trying to provide everyone with equal opportunity. I really appreciate that.
My dad now gets a pension every month. I heard many other old people in our community also get it.
